    """Implicit global registry and lookup.

    Crom supports an implicit registry and lookup to be set up
    globally.  Registration of components using grokkers will use the
    implicit global IRegistry instance for registration. Lookups using
    the ICromInterface extension to interface will use the global
    ILookup instance.

    The global registry is normally only set up once per application,
    during startup time. It can be set up to the default crom registry
    using the initialize method. This also sets up a lookup for this
    registry. Afterwards, the registry can be accessed through the
    ``registry`` property (but cannot be set through this).

    In addition to the implicit global registry, an application can
    also use explicit registry objects. The registry to use can be set
    explicitly per registration, using the @registry decorator when
    registering a component using a grokker.

    The global implicit lookup can be accessed through the ``lookup``
    property. The global implicit lookup is used in the ICromInterface
    extensions to Interface to look up components. If you don't want
    to use the global implicit lookup with this API, you can pass an
    explicit ``lookup`` argument instead.

    Changing the implicit lookup during run-time is done by simply
    assigning to it. Typically you'd assign an ILookup constructed
    using crom.ListLookup or crom.ChainLookup. This way a lookup can
    look for a component in one registry first, and then fall back to
    another registry, etc.

    To change the lookup back to a lookup in the global implicit
    registry, call ``reset_lookup``.

    The implicit lookup is thread-local: each thread has a separate
    implicit global lookup.
